  "excerpt": "How Australia's leading hotels are pioneering eco-luxury approaches and why sustainability doesn't mean sacrificing exceptional experiences.",
  "content": "<p>The notion that luxury and sustainability exist in opposition is rapidly becoming outdated. Through my work at Harbour View Luxury Hotel and with various hospitality clients at Celestial Celebrations, I've observed a meaningful shift in how premium experiences are conceived and delivered.</p>\n      <p>The most forward-thinking Australian properties are proving that environmental consciousness can enhance rather than detract from guest experiences: hyperlocal sourcing that ensures peak freshness, plastic-free approaches that introduce beautiful alternatives, energy-efficient systems that improve comfort while reducing impact.</p>",
