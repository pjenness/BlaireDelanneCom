  "content": "<p>They say the light in Sydney is different, and now I understand why artists and photographers have long been drawn to this harbor city. There's a clarity and warmth to the sunshine here that transforms everything it touches—from the gleaming white sails of the Opera House to the golden stretches of beach.</p>\n      <p>What has surprised me most is how the city's relationship with the ocean shapes daily life. Even in luxury settings, there's a relaxed elegance that feels distinctly Australian—a refinement that never tips into stiffness. You might see someone in a beautifully tailored linen suit in a five-star hotel who just came from a morning swim at Bondi.</p>",
