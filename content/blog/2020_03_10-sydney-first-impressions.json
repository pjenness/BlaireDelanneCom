  "content": "<p>Week two in Sydney and I'm still jet-lagged as hell. Woke up at 4 AM again today and decided to walk to the harbor to watch the sunrise. Turns out this was accidentally brilliant because the light here is INSANE. Like, I've heard photographers talk about \"quality of light\" before and always thought it was pretentious BS, but they weren't kidding about Sydney. Everything glows differently. The Opera House literally changes colors throughout the day. Maybe it's the cleaner air or being surrounded by water, but it makes even my crappy phone photos look semi-professional.</p>\n\n      <p>Been comparing everything to New York and annoying myself doing it. The trains are cleaner. The coffee is better (seriously, what is this \"flat white\" magic?). People actually smile at strangers. But I miss the pizza terribly – had something claiming to be a New York slice yesterday that was an absolute travesty. Also can't get used to people driving on the left side. Nearly got flattened twice today looking the wrong way before crossing.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2020_03_10-sydney-first-impressions_img02.jpg\" alt=\"Sunrise view of Sydney Harbor Bridge from my morning walk\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <p>The apartment I rented online is... not exactly as advertised. The \"harbor view\" requires hanging halfway out the bathroom window and craning your neck to the right. And apparently \"cozy\" is Australian for \"so small you have to step into the hallway to change your mind.\" But the location is perfect and my neighbors seem nice, though I can't understand half of what they're saying. The Aussie accent gets thicker when they're being friendly, which is both charming and completely incomprehensible.</p>\n\n      <p>I moved into Potts Point, which has this fascinating mix of historic architecture, trendy restaurants, and lingering seediness that reminds me a bit of certain parts of Manhattan before they got completely gentrified. My street has a fancy patisserie next to what appears to be a decades-old dive bar, next to a high-end boutique. Last night I heard a heated argument that contained at least five uses of the word \"mate\" in increasingly threatening tones, followed by laughter and what sounded like friendly drinking. Still figuring out the social dynamics here.</p>\n\n      <p>Weirdest observation so far: business attire here is bizarrely casual compared to NYC. My new boss showed up to our first meeting in shorts and flip-flops (sorry, \"thongs\" – learned quickly that's what they call them here, which led to an awkward misunderstanding). He had just come from a morning swim and had salt on his shirt collar. In New York, this would be career suicide, but here it's just... Tuesday. When I overdressed for my second day at work, one of my colleagues actually asked if I had a job interview afterward.</p>\n\n      <p>Starting to wonder if I overpacked. Half my wardrobe feels too formal, too dark, too... New York. Might need to do some shopping this weekend if I want to blend in better. The locals seem to have mastered this effortless, beachy elegance that I'm completely failing at so far. Tried to recreate the \"just came from the beach\" look this morning but ended up looking like I'd been caught in a rainstorm instead.</p>\n\n      <p>Food here is incredible, if disorienting. Everything seems to have an Asian influence, from the coffee shops serving \"breakfast ramen\" to corner stores stocking more varieties of seaweed snacks than potato chips. I had dinner at a Thai place where the spice level nearly killed me – apparently when they say \"Australian hot\" they mean \"surface of the sun.\" The seafood is unsurprisingly amazing. Had fish and chips at a place by the harbor that made me momentarily forget about my pizza deprivation.</p>\n\n      <p>The most unexpected part of Sydney so far? The wildlife. There's a colony of fruit bats that flies over my apartment every evening – massive, prehistoric-looking creatures that darkened the sky for several minutes. Cockatoos and rainbow lorikeets hang out in the trees like regular birds. And yesterday I had to pause my morning run because a family of brush turkeys was blocking the path and refused to move, staring me down like I was the weird one. Made me realize how tame NYC's pigeons and rats seem in comparison.</p>\n\n      <p>Still, despite the jet lag and the culture shock, I catch myself grinning like an idiot at random moments. There's something magical about starting completely fresh in a place where nobody knows you. I walked along Bondi Beach yesterday evening and had this moment of total clarity – this was absolutely the right decision, even if I still can't figure out the coins here (seriously, why is the 5 cent piece bigger than the 10 cent piece?!).</p>\n\n      <p>Met a few people from work for drinks last night. One of them – Michael – offered to show me around the Northern Beaches this weekend. Not sure if it's a date or just Aussie friendliness, but I guess I'll find out. After everything that happened in New York, I'm hesitant to dive into anything romantic, but it might be nice to have a local guide. He surfs (of course he does) and promised to take me to the best breakfast spot in Manly. Taking baby steps into this new social landscape, but it feels good to be making connections already.</p>",
