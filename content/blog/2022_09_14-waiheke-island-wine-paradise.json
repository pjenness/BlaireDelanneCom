  "excerpt": "Exploring Auckland's island wine region and how its distinctive terroir creates world-class wines with a character all their own.",
  "content": "<p>Just a 40-minute ferry ride from downtown Auckland lies a world of vineyards cascading down hills to sparkling blue bays. Waiheke Island has rapidly become one of my favorite places to bring visitors seeking an experience that combines natural beauty, exceptional food and wine, and a distinctly New Zealand sense of relaxed sophistication.</p>\n      <p>What makes Waiheke wines special is not just the stunning settings of the vineyards, but the distinctive growing conditions. The island's maritime climate, with its cooling sea breezes and varied topography, creates ideal conditions for Bordeaux-style reds and elegant Chardonnays with a character that couldn't be replicated elsewhere.</p>",
