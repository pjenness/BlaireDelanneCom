  "excerpt": "How couples in New Zealand are pioneering eco-conscious celebrations and the innovative ways we're reducing the environmental impact of special events.",
  "content": "<p>When a recently engaged couple approached me about planning their wedding, they had one non-negotiable requirement: the celebration needed to align with their environmental values without sacrificing beauty or guest experience. This request reflects a growing trend I've observed since establishing my consultancy in New Zealand.</p>\n      <p>What's distinctive about the Kiwi approach to sustainable celebrations is how it extends beyond superficial \"green\" gestures to encompass thoughtful consideration of every elementâ€”from locally grown flowers arranged in reusable vessels to rental attire for the wedding party to comprehensive composting systems.</p>",
