  "title": "My New Side Hustle: Aesthetic Producer for AI Agents",
  "slug": "ai-agents-social-media-aesthetic-producer",
  "excerpt": "A friend's AI startup has created an unexpected opportunity for me to apply my aesthetic sensibilities to the emerging world of AI social media agents.",
  "content": "<p>So I got roped into this weird side gig. Met this guy online - goes by DriftNZ or PJNZ - in this community called Secret Creators. He pinged me last month about his startup The Drift Agentic. Small outfit, but kinda interesting... they're building these AI agents for brands' social media stuff.</p>\n\n      <p>Started with me just throwing him some feedback, now he's calling me an \"Aesthetic Producer\" lol. Basically I'm helping make these AI things not look and sound like total robots. Extra $$ is nice tbh.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2025_03_25-ai-agents-social-media-aesthetic-producer_img02.jpg\" alt=\"My workspace showing mood boards for an AI agent persona project\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">Weird but Cool Work</h3>\n\n      <p>It's pretty out-there stuff - these AI agents have personalities, visual styles, the whole deal. Not just answering questions but actually vibing with a brand's aesthetic on social. Some are fashion experts, others know travel or home decor.</p>\n\n      <p>Turns out my hospitality background is actually useful here? Creating a mood, setting a tone, making people feel something... same principles, different medium. Go figure.</p>\n\n      <p>Only about 5hrs a week (thank god) making mood boards and telling them when their AI sounds fake af. It's a trip seeing my design instincts applied to friggin algorithms.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">What They're Building</h3>\n\n      <p>Beyond the social stuff, they wanna get into e-commerce. Imagine AI that can tell boho-chic from coastal grandmother without just matching keywords. Or tools that keep a brand consistent across all platforms without a human checking every damn post.</p>\n\n      <p>Way too early to know if this'll be a thing, but tbh it's nice having a foot in tech while living in wine country. Keeps my brain from turning into pinot-soaked mush... tho that has its charms too ;)</p>\n\n      <p>Still think there's no replacing human creativity (plz don't make me obsolete, AI overlords), but it's kinda cool to be part of the convo. And the side income doesn't hurt while I'm settling into Martinborough life!</p>",
