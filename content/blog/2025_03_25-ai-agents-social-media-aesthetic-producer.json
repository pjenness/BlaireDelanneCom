  "content": "<p>I've started an interesting side project with someone I met online in a social training community called Secret Creators. His online username is DriftNZ or sometimes PJNZ, and he reached out last month about his startup TheDriftAgentic. It's a small but ambitious AI company focusing on social media agents for brands and commercial applications.</p>\n\n      <p>What started as casual advice has turned into a part-time consulting role that he's calling \"Aesthetic Producer\" — basically helping design the visual style and personality of AI agents for social media and advertising.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2025_03_25-ai-agents-social-media-aesthetic-producer_img02.jpg\" alt=\"My workspace showing mood boards for an AI agent persona project\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">Experimental AI Work</h3>\n\n      <p>This is very experimental territory — these AI agents are designed to have consistent personas that help brands connect with their audience on social platforms. They're not just chatbots but have visual styles, communication patterns, and specialized knowledge in fashion, travel, or home décor.</p>\n\n      <p>My background in hospitality and events actually translates well to this work. I'm helping ensure these AI personas feel authentic and aligned with the brands they represent, especially for luxury and lifestyle companies.</p>\n\n      <p>I'm working remotely about 5 hours a week, creating mood boards and visual guides for these AI personas, and advising on how they should communicate in different contexts. It's fascinating to see how my sense of aesthetics can be applied to something so technical.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">Commercial Applications</h3>\n\n      <p>Beyond social media, they're exploring how these agents can enhance online shopping and advertising experiences. The goal is to create AI assistants that understand nuanced aesthetic preferences better than current recommendation systems.</p>\n\n      <p>For example, a fashion-focused agent that can actually understand the difference between various style interpretations rather than just matching keywords. Or advertising tools that maintain brand consistency across different platforms.</p>\n\n      <p>It's early days, but I'm enjoying how this side project complements my main work in Martinborough. Living in wine country but staying connected to emerging tech feels like a perfect balance. And applying aesthetic judgment to AI systems is a reminder that human creativity remains essential even as technology advances.</p>",
