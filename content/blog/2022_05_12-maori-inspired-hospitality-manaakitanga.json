  "excerpt": "Learning from New Zealand's Indigenous concepts of hospitality and how they're shaping my approach to creating meaningful guest experiences.",
  "content": "<p>One of the most beautiful words I've encountered since moving to New Zealand is \"manaakitanga\"—a Māori concept that encompasses hospitality, kindness, generosity, and respect for others. It's a philosophy that extends far beyond service transactions to embrace genuine care for visitors' wellbeing and the sharing of place and culture.</p>\n      <p>Through conversations with Māori cultural experts and hospitality professionals, I've been deepening my understanding of how this concept manifests in everything from arrival rituals to food sharing to storytelling. These principles are profoundly influencing how I'm developing experiences for my clients.</p>",
