  "excerpt": "First impressions of New Zealand's largest city and the unexpected ways it differs from both New York and Sydney.",
  "content": "<p>They call Auckland the City of Sails, and it's immediately apparent why. The harbor bristles with masts, the horizon is dotted with white triangles catching the breeze, and it seems everyone has a story about being on the water. This intimate relationship with the harbor shapes Auckland's character in ways that feel distinct from other coastal cities I've called home.</p>\n      <p>What's most striking about Auckland is the seamless integration of urban sophistication and natural beauty. Within thirty minutes of downtown's sleek high-rises, you can be on a black sand beach, hiking through rainforest, or sampling wines at a vineyard. This accessibility to diverse experiences creates unique possibilities for the hospitality experiences I hope to design here.</p>",
