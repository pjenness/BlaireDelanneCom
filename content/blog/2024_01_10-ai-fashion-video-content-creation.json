  "content": "<p>K so this AI stuff is moving CRAZY fast. Since messing with those image generators, tech has gone nuts. Lately playing with two new toys: AI video makers and AI fashion visualizers.</p>\n\n      <p>Super useful when I'm constantly showing clients event mockups, venue ideas, and \"what to wear\" advice for fancy NZ weddings.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2024_01_10-ai-fashion-video-content-creation_img02.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of an AI-generated fashion visualization showing formal attire with Martinborough vineyard backdrop\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">AI Videos: Making Static Stuff Move</h3>\n\n      <p>Been testing tons of AI video tools. Runway's Gen-2 wins so far - literally type what you want, boom: video clip. Or take regular pic and make it move. Wild.</p>\n\n      <p>For event planning? Gold. Made samples showing flickering candles on tables or swaying fabric installations. Way better than explaining with boring still pics.</p>\n\n      <p>Perfect? Nah. Look trippy sometimes, like someone filmed a dream. But for concept meetings, clients eat it up. Shows the ~vibe~ better than static mockups.</p>\n\n      <p>Using for Insta too. Adding subtle movement to past event pics. Table setting gets way more engagement when candles flicker or wine pours. People stop scrolling for that shit.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">AI Fashion: Virtual Try-Ons</h3>\n\n      <p>Even cooler: fashion AI tools. I mostly do events, but end up giving tons of style advice - what to wear to events, how to dress for NZ's bipolar weather, etc.</p>\n\n      <p>Testing DressX and CALA - make virtual clothing previews. Instead of sending million ASOS links, I show how outfits would look in specific venues.</p>\n\n      <p>Example: Fancy Martinborough vineyard wedding this autumn. Made AI images showing dress styles against actual venue with right lighting. Bride was like \"omg exactly what I needed\" instead of trying to imagine studio photos in a vineyard setting.</p>\n\n      <p>For corporate retreats, shown what to pack. Like what \"smart casual\" actually means for welcome dinner vs yoga clothes vs hiking gear for team building. Saves everyone from packing wrong.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">The Not-So-Great Parts</h3>\n\n      <p>These tools have issues. Fashion ones struggle with body types and details (beadwork or lace = disaster). Video ones make short clips where things move... wrong. Uncanny valley wrong.</p>\n\n      <p>Ethics are messy. Fashion designers mad these tools copy styles without payment. Video stuff even sketchier - making realistic clips of things that never happened. Eek.</p>\n\n      <p>My rule: use for brainstorming only, never final products. Upfront with clients about what's AI vs real. Still hire humans for important stuff - they need jobs and they're better anyway.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">Mixing Old & New</h3>\n\n      <p>Best approach: AI for initial concepts, then real professionals to execute. I'll generate 10 quick styling ideas, then get human stylist to make best one happen. Or show concept video, then hire videographer for actual event.</p>\n\n      <p>Clients are split - most think it's helpful, some get weird about it. Learned to read the room before showing AI stuff.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">What's Next</h3>\n\n      <p>These tools will be standard for creative businesses soon. Showing clients multiple options super fast is just too valuable.</p>\n\n      <p>For small operators like me without fancy teams, this levels the playing field. Can offer previews that used to need massive agency budgets.</p>\n\n      <p>And this is just the beginning! If these keep improving like the image ones did, next year = 10x better. Terrifying but exciting?</p>\n\n      <p>Still focused on the human part tho - building relationships, creating memorable moments, making spaces feel special. Tech just helps clients see what's in my head before we actually build it.</p>",
