  "content": "<p>K so this AI stuff is moving crazy fast. Since I started messing with those image generators, the tech has gone nuts. Lately I've been playing with two new toys: AI video makers and AI fashion visualizers.</p>\n\n      <p>Pretty useful for someone like me who's always showing clients event mockups, venue ideas, and \"what to wear\" advice for fancy NZ weddings.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2024_01_10-ai-fashion-video-content-creation_img02.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of an AI-generated fashion visualization showing formal attire with Martinborough vineyard backdrop\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">AI Videos: Making Static Stuff Move</h3>\n\n      <p>Been testing a bunch of AI video tools. Runway's Gen-2 is the winner so far - you can literally type what you want and it makes a lil video clip, or take a regular pic and make it move. Wild.</p>\n\n      <p>For my event planning biz, this is gold. Made some samples showing how candles flicker on tables or how those hanging fabric things sway in the breeze. Way better than trying to explain that stuff with boring still pics.</p>\n\n      <p>Are they perfect? Nah. They look a bit trippy sometimes, like someone filmed a dream. But for early concept meetings, clients eat it up. Shows the ~vibe~ better than static mockups.</p>\n\n      <p>Been using it for Insta too. Taking pics from past events and adding subtle movement. A still photo of a table setting gets way more engagement when you can see the candles flickering or wine being poured. People stop scrolling for that shit.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">AI Fashion: Virtual Try-Ons</h3>\n\n      <p>Even cooler for me are these new fashion AI tools. While I mostly do events and hospitality stuff, I end up giving a ton of style advice too - what to wear to which events, how to dress for NZ's bipolar weather, etc.</p>\n\n      <p>Been testing DressX and CALA - they let you make virtual clothing previews. Instead of sending clients a million ASOS links, I can actually show them how different outfits would look in the specific venue they're going to.</p>\n\n      <p>Example: Got this fancy vineyard wedding coming up in Martinborough this autumn. Made some AI images showing how different dress styles and colors would look against the actual venue with the right lighting. Bride was like \"omg this is exactly what I needed\" instead of trying to imagine how some random model in a studio photo would translate to standing between grapevines at sunset.</p>\n\n      <p>For corporate retreats, I've shown people what to pack for different activities. Like, here's what \"smart casual\" actually means for the welcome dinner vs what to wear for morning yoga vs hiking clothes for the team building nonsense. Saves everyone from packing wrong and feeling awkward.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">The Not-So-Great Parts</h3>\n\n      <p>These tools def have issues. The fashion ones struggle with body types and complex details (don't even try to show beadwork or lace lol). The video ones only make short clips and sometimes things move... wrong. Like uncanny valley wrong.</p>\n\n      <p>The ethics are messy too. Fashion designers are pissed that these tools can basically copy their style without paying them. And video stuff is even sketchier - you can make realistic-looking clips of things that never happened. Eek.</p>\n\n      <p>My rule: only use these for brainstorming and concept stuff, never final products. I'm upfront with clients about what's AI vs real photography. And I still hire actual humans for the important stuff - photographers, videographers, stylists. They need jobs and they're better anyway.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">Mixing Old & New</h3>\n\n      <p>Best approach I've found is using AI for the boring initial stuff, then bringing in real professionals to execute. Like I'll gen up 10 quick styling concepts with AI, then get a human stylist to actually make the best one happen. Or show a concept video to clients, then hire a real videographer to capture the actual event.</p>\n\n      <p>Clients are split - most think it's cool and helpful during planning, some get weird about it and prefer traditional approaches. I've learned to read the room before pulling out the AI tricks.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">What's Next</h3>\n\n      <p>Pretty sure these tools will be standard for all creative businesses soon. The ability to show clients multiple options super fast is just too valuable.</p>\n\n      <p>For small operators like me without a fancy team, these tech tools level the playing field. I can offer clients the kind of previews that used to require a massive agency budget.</p>\n\n      <p>And this is just the beginning! If these tools keep improving like the text and image ones did, next year they'll be 10x better. Kinda terrifying but also exciting?</p>\n\n      <p>End of day tho, I'm still focused on the human part of what I do - building relationships, creating moments people remember, making spaces feel special. The tech just helps clients see what's in my head before we actually build it.</p>",
