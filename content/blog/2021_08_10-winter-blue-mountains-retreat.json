  "content": "<p>I'm writing this with frozen fingers because this \"charming heritage cottage\" in the Blue Mountains apparently doesn't believe in adequate heating. Note to self: when Australians describe something as having \"authentic period features,\" it means \"we haven't updated anything since 1932, including insulation.\"</p>\n\n      <p>But I'm getting ahead of myself. This trip started as a desperate attempt to escape Sydney for a weekend. My housemate Jen has been driving me crazy with her weird kombucha experiments that have taken over our entire kitchen (the smell... dear god, the smell), so when a colleague offered her family's Blue Mountains cottage for a \"nominal cleaning fee,\" I jumped at the chance.</p>\n\n      <p>The drive up was actually gorgeous. As we climbed into the mountains, the temperature dropped and this ethereal mist started wrapping around everything. I had to pull over twice just to take pictures because it was like driving through a fairytale. This part of Australia is so different from the beaches and harbors I've gotten used to - all eucalyptus forests and dramatic cliff faces.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2021_08_10-winter-blue-mountains-retreat_img02.jpg\" alt=\"View from the cottage window showing misty Blue Mountains forest at dawn\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <p>Reality hit when we arrived at the cottage and discovered the heat was broken. The caretaker, this ancient guy named Keith with the thickest Aussie accent I've heard yet, just shrugged and said, \"Just use the fireplace, love.\" Thankfully the fireplace worked great and kept things cozy, even if I'm not exactly an expert at building fires. Keith stopped by later to drop off more wood and gave us some tips on the best walking trails in the area.</p>\n\n      <p>We ventured into the nearest town (Leura) for dinner, ending up at this tiny restaurant that only had about eight tables. No menu - the owner just tells you what they're cooking that day. I was skeptical, but the lamb stew they served was literally the best thing I've eaten since moving to Australia. Paired with a local red wine that the owner insisted we try, it was worth every penny. Also met this older couple at the next table who've been coming to the Blue Mountains every winter for 42 years. They had some wild stories about how the area has changed - apparently one of the hiking trails used to be a smuggling route during prohibition times.</p>\n\n      <p>This morning I woke up to find the cottage completely enveloped in fog so thick I couldn't see more than a few feet beyond the windows. Decided to embrace the spooky vibes and went for a walk. The silence was incredible - no traffic noise, no people, just occasional bird calls and the sound of water dripping from trees. Found this little waterfall that was partially frozen at the edges, which was magical.</p>\n\n      <p>I followed one of Keith's recommended trails and ended up at this lookout point called Echo Point that overlooks these massive rock formations called the Three Sisters. According to Aboriginal legend, they're three sisters who were turned to stone by a tribal elder to protect them from danger. The mist was clearing just enough that I could see them emerging and disappearing again like ghosts. Took about a hundred photos but none of them capture how eerie and beautiful it was.</p>\n\n      <p>On the way back, stopped at this tiny café for lunch where they make everything in-house, including the bread. Had this incredible soup with local mushrooms that the owner forages himself. He told me the Blue Mountains have some of Australia's best edible fungi, which I guess makes sense given the climate. While I was eating, it started to snow lightly outside - just a few flakes but enough to make everyone in the café rush to the windows in excitement. Apparently snow is rare enough here to be noteworthy.</p>\n\n      <p>The cold is still brutal though, and I'm pretty sure there's a possum living in the roof. Every time I start to drift off to sleep, there's a scratching sound directly above my head. Between that and having to get up twice to add more wood to the fire, I've barely slept. But looking out at the misty valley below while drinking my morning coffee (thank god I brought my own because there was only instant here), I get why people love this place.</p>\n\n      <p>Called Michael last night to tell him about the trip, and he laughed at my city-girl complaints about the cold. He grew up in Tasmania where apparently this kind of weather is just called \"Tuesday.\" He's promised to take me to some even more remote spots in the Blue Mountains next time - apparently there are hidden swimming holes and caves that most tourists never see. Not sure if that's enticing or terrifying.</p>\n\n      <p>Will I come back? Ask me after I've had a hot shower in Sydney tomorrow. But probably yes, just... maybe in spring.</p>",
