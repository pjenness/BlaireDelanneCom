  "content": "<p>Some spaces have a soul that's immediately perceptible when you enter. The Fern Boutique Hotel, with its soaring art deco-inspired atrium, bold striped carpets, and eclectic collection of New Zealand art, is such a place. I knew upon my first visit that this was an environment that aligned with my own vision of hospitalityâ€”design-forward yet deeply comfortable, distinctive without being pretentious.</p>\n      <p>When the opportunity arose to collaborate with them on special events and guest experiences, it felt like a natural partnership. Together, we're developing a series of cultural salons that bring together local artists, winemakers, and culinary talents for intimate evenings that showcase the creative spirit of Auckland.</p>",
