  "content": "<p>Day freaking 94 of this COVID nightmare. Should be grateful to still have a job when half our staff's gone, but working in an empty hotel is creepy AF. The Harbour View has 312 rooms and we have exactly 8 guests rn. EIGHT!!! All either stranded travelers or businesspeople doing mandatory quarantine. Our massive lobby echoes like a horror movie whenever anyone walks through.</p>\n\n      <p>Four kitchen staff tested positive last week ðŸ˜· Management tried to keep it quiet (shocker) but word spread fast. Now everyone's paranoid, giving death stares if someone clears their throat. Masks 24/7 giving me gross acne along my jawline - super attractive. Plus masks hide expressions which makes that warm, personal service thing (MY ENTIRE JOB) basically impossible.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2020_06_18-pandemic-hospitality-uncertain-times_img02.jpg\" alt=\"The eerily empty luxury hotel lobby with sanitization stations\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <p>FaceTimed parents yesterday and completely lost it crying. This Australia move was supposed to be an amazing adventure, now I'm trapped in pandemic purgatory. Can't go home bc travel restrictions, can't explore my new country bc everything's closed. Mom tried the \"at least you're somewhere warm\" thing which just made me feel like a whiny brat for complaining when people are literally dying.</p>\n\n      <p>Silver lining: those of us still here have gotten tight. Like this weird pandemic family. Raj from engineering taught me cricket in the empty ballroom after our shifts (def breaking rules but who's checking?). Mel from reception's teaching me proper Aussie slang - apparently I've been saying Melbourne wrong this whole time (it's \"MEL-bin\" not \"MEL-BORN\" who knew??)</p>\n\n      <p>Started ridiculous traditions to keep sane. Fridays after shift, we meet for \"Fancy Apocalypse\" - raid unused mini bar stock and dress up in random stuff. Last week wore a tablecloth cape and Raj made a crown from folded room service menus. Stupid and childish but gives us something to actually look forward to.</p>\n\n      <p>Weirdest part is reimagining what \"luxury service\" even means now. Used to be about anticipating needs, getting close to guests, creating experiences. Now it's JUST about making people feel SAFE. We're marketing cleaning protocols as luxury amenities! \"Enjoy our hospital-grade disinfection!\" Never thought I'd be proudly showing off UV sanitizing equipment like some fancy feature.</p>\n\n      <p>Got in a heated debate with Michael about whether this changes hospitality forever or if everything bounces back post-vaccine. He thinks we'll return to normal - in-room dining, turndown service, packed bars. Not buying it. Something feels permanently different about shared spaces now. Maybe it's my NY paranoia but I can't imagine looking at a hotel buffet the same way again. Communal tongs?? HARD PASS.</p>\n\n      <p>Trying to get creative with isolation. Created \"Quarantine Concierge\" packages for our few guests - movie nights with themed snacks, virtual wine tastings (leave bottles outside, Zoom for guidance), even custom in-room workouts. Actually kinda fun. Never thought my hospitality career would involve teaching a 60-year-old CEO yoga via FaceTime, but 2020 is nothing if not ~surprising~.</p>\n\n      <p>Management keeps saying things will bounce back but idk. Some days I consider just giving up and trying to get home (if they'd let me in), but job market there is probably 10x worse. So here I am, fancy uniform to serve 8 people and obsessively disinfect surfaces nobody's touched. What a time for luxury hospitality!!</p>",
