  "content": "<p>I'm decent with words I guess - can explain stuff to clients without totally mangling my design ideas. But real talk: writing proposals, website blurbs, and marketing crap is my personal hell. Takes forever, makes me want to throw my laptop out the window, and steals time from the actual creative work I don't hate.</p>\n\n      <p>So ChatGPT. You know, that AI thing everyone's obsessed with lately. Been playing with it for a few months and honestly? Game changer for the writing parts of my job.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2023_04_15-chatgpt-business-writing-workflow_img02.jpg\" alt=\"My laptop workspace showing a client proposal draft being refined with AI assistance\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">Finding What Actually Works</h3>\n\n      <p>First tries were rubbish. Asked it to write entire proposals from scratch but everything sounded like some corporate robot wrote it (which, duh, it did). The AI had no clue about my clients, my style, or how we do things down in NZ.</p>\n\n      <p>What's working way better: I feed it my messy ideas and it helps organize and polish them. Less ghostwriter, more like that friend who's better at writing than you who helps fix your jumbled thoughts.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">How I'm Using It</h3>\n\n      <p>After client meetings, I just ramble voice notes into my phone - raw impressions, half-formed ideas, specific details about their venue or whatever. Transcribe that mess (sometimes with another AI thingy), then ask ChatGPT to make it sound like a professional wrote it lol.</p>\n\n      <p>When I'm stuck describing something weird, I'll type exactly what I'm thinking, and it spits out actual usable language. Like last week I couldn't explain this lighting setup I wanted for this forest wedding. Told ChatGPT \"ya know, like when light comes thru trees but magical and not too bright?\" and it suggested \"dappled luminescence that mimics moonlight filtering through forest canopy.\" Client ate that shit up.</p>\n\n      <p>For socials and my site, I get it to help me write variations of the same basic info. Super handy for making Instagram captions that don't sound identical to the long version on my website.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">Time = Money</h3>\n\n      <p>Biggest win? Not spending my whole Sunday night writing ONE damn proposal. Used to take me 3-4 hours of misery, now it's like 45 mins. Which means I can take more jobs without working myself to death, or *gasp* actually have a life outside work.</p>\n\n      <p>Bonus: my writing's actually getting better. After seeing how it reworks my jumbled thoughts into clear sentences, I'm picking up patterns. Like having a writing tutor who never gets annoyed with you for asking the same questions.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">Where It Sucks</h3>\n\n      <p>It's def not perfect. Always trying to sneak in American phrases nobody says in NZ. Can't capture the specific vibe of meeting clients in person. And sometimes it writes these painfully formal sentences that sound like a corporate brochure - I call this \"LinkedIn Voice\" and it makes me cringe.</p>\n\n      <p>Which is why I always edit everything it gives me. Add my actual personality, throw in local references, make sure it sounds like me and not some business school graduate. If I didn't, clients who meet me then read my proposals would get serious whiplash.</p>\n\n      <p>Some stuff I would NEVER use AI for - personal thank you notes, apology emails when something's gone wrong, or anything needing actual human empathy. That needs to come from me, not a computer.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">The Ethics Bit</h3>\n\n      <p>Yeah I've thought about whether this is cheating or whatever. I'm not hiding that I use tech tools, but I also don't announce \"THIS EMAIL WAS AIDED BY AI\" anymore than I'd put \"SENT FROM GMAIL\" at the bottom of messages.</p>\n\n      <p>What matters to me is that everything still reflects my actual professional judgement and style. The AI just helps me sound less scattered. It's expressing MY ideas more clearly, not replacing my expertise or personal touch.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">What's Next</h3>\n\n      <p>These AI things are getting better scary fast. Hoping they'll get better at understanding NZ contexts and hospitality/events industry specifics.</p>\n\n      <p>For now tho, ChatGPT is a keeper in my work toolkit. Not taking over my job, just handling the parts I suck at. Helping me sound like the best version of myself, not some robot impersonator. And in this industry where human connection is literally everything, that balance feels right to me.</p>",
