  "content": "<p>I've always considered myself reasonably good with words—enough to communicate clearly with clients and convey the vision behind my event designs. But let's be honest: crafting compelling proposals, website copy, and marketing materials has never been the part of my job I look forward to most. It's time-consuming, sometimes frustrating, and pulls me away from the creative and interpersonal work I truly love.</p>\n\n      <p>Enter ChatGPT, the AI language model that's been everywhere in the news lately. After several months of experimentation, I've integrated it into my workflow in ways that genuinely transform how I approach the writing aspects of my business.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2023_04_15-chatgpt-business-writing-workflow_img02.jpg\" alt=\"My laptop workspace showing a client proposal draft being refined with AI assistance\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">Finding My Approach</h3>\n\n      <p>Initially, I struggled to find the right balance. My first attempts involved asking ChatGPT to write entire proposals or website sections from scratch, but the results felt generic and lacked my voice. The AI didn't know my clients, my design philosophy, or the specific New Zealand context I work within.</p>\n\n      <p>What has worked much better is a collaborative approach where I provide the meaningful substance and perspective, then use ChatGPT to help with structure, clarity, and polish. It's become less of a ghostwriter and more of an editor and brainstorming partner.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">My Current Workflow</h3>\n\n      <p>For client proposals, I now start by making voice notes after initial consultations, capturing my authentic impressions, ideas, and the specific details that make each project unique. I transcribe these notes (sometimes using another AI tool), then ask ChatGPT to help organize them into a coherent structure with proper transitions.</p>\n\n      <p>When I'm stuck on how to articulate a particular concept, I'll describe what I'm trying to convey conversationally, and the AI helps me find more precise language. For example, I recently struggled to explain a particular lighting concept for an outdoor wedding. After describing the effect I wanted in simple terms, ChatGPT suggested the phrase \"dappled luminescence that mimics moonlight filtering through forest canopy\"—exactly the poetic but clear description I needed.</p>\n\n      <p>For my website and marketing materials, I use the AI to help generate variations of key messages, then mix and match elements to create something that truly reflects my voice and values. It's particularly helpful for creating different versions of the same content for various platforms—taking a detailed service description and creating a more concise version for Instagram, for instance.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">The Time Factor</h3>\n\n      <p>The most immediate benefit has been time savings. Tasks that once took me hours now take minutes. Writing a comprehensive wedding planning proposal used to consume an entire evening; now I can create a polished first draft in under an hour. This efficiency means I can take on more clients without sacrificing the quality of my service or my work-life balance.</p>\n\n      <p>But beyond simple efficiency, I've found that using ChatGPT actually improves my writing over time. By seeing how it restructures my thoughts or suggests alternative phrasings, I'm learning to be more precise and effective in my communication. It's like having a writing coach available 24/7.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">The Limitations</h3>\n\n      <p>Of course, ChatGPT is far from perfect. It sometimes suggests American terms or references that don't resonate in New Zealand. It can't capture the unique energy of a particular client interaction or the specific aesthetic sensibility I've developed over years in the industry. And it occasionally produces writing that sounds a bit too formal or generic—what I call \"corporate smooth.\"</p>\n\n      <p>That's why human oversight remains crucial. I carefully review and edit everything the AI helps me produce, injecting my personality, adding specific cultural references, and ensuring the tone matches both my brand and the specific client's preferences.</p>\n\n      <p>There are also certain types of content I wouldn't use AI for—personal notes to clients, for example, or anything that requires genuine emotional connection. Those communications need to come directly from me, without technological mediation.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">Ethical Considerations</h3>\n\n      <p>I've thought carefully about the ethics of using AI in my business communications. I believe in transparency with clients about my process, though I don't necessarily announce \"this proposal was drafted with AI assistance\" any more than I would specify which word processor or grammar checking tool I use.</p>\n\n      <p>The key ethical principle for me is authenticity—ensuring that all client communications genuinely reflect my professional judgment, aesthetic sensibility, and commitment to their vision. The AI is a tool that helps me express these things more effectively, not a replacement for my expertise or personal touch.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">Looking Forward</h3>\n\n      <p>As AI language models continue to evolve, I expect they'll become even more useful for small business owners like me. I'm particularly interested in tools that can better understand local contexts and specialized industries.</p>\n\n      <p>For now, ChatGPT has found a permanent place in my business toolkit—not replacing my voice, but amplifying it; not doing my thinking for me, but helping me communicate my thoughts more effectively. In an industry built on human connection and creativity, that's exactly the right balance to strike with artificial intelligence.</p>",
