  "excerpt": "How thoughtful table design creates the foundation for extraordinary gatherings and the elements that elevate a dining setting from pretty to transportive.",
  "content": "<p>A beautifully set table is more than an aesthetic pleasure—it's the stage upon which shared experiences unfold. Through my work designing special events, I've come to appreciate how deliberately composed dining environments influence everything from conversation flow to flavor perception to memory formation.</p>\n      <p>What I find most fascinating is how cultural context shapes these settings. The tablescaping approach I've developed in New Zealand incorporates elements distinct to this place—native foliage like silver fern and nikau palm, locally crafted ceramics with volcanic glazes, pounamu (greenstone) accents that connect to Māori traditions.</p>",
