  "content": "<p>They say that once you start traveling, it's difficult to stop. My journey from New York to Sydney has been transformative both personally and professionally, and now I'm embracing another transition: a move to New Zealand in early 2022.</p>\n      <p>This next step feels different from previous ones. Rather than joining an established organization, I'll be launching my own hospitality and event design consultancy. It's a decision that combines everything I've learned from the structured excellence of places like The Luminous Grand Hotel and Harbour View Luxury Hotel with the creative flexibility I've developed at Celestial Celebrations.</p>",
