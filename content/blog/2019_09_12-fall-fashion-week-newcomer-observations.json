  "excerpt": "My first experience attending New York Fashion Week events and how the energy of runway shows has influenced my understanding of style narratives.",
  "content": "<p>The anticipation before the lights dim. The first notes of music. The collective intake of breath as the initial look appears. There's nothing quite like the theatrical experience of a runway show during Fashion Week.</p>\n      <p>Thanks to connections through The Luminous Grand Hotel, I was able to attend several shows this season, and the experience has transformed how I think about fashion. Beyond the clothes themselves, I was struck by how designers create complete worlds through music, setting, and the careful sequencing of looks.</p>",
