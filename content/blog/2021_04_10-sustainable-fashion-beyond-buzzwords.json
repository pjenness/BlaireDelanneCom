  "content": "<p>I've been thinking a lot about sustainable fashion lately. Living in Sydney has changed how I view my closet – Australians seem to have a more relaxed relationship with their clothing, investing in fewer, better pieces rather than constantly chasing trends like we did in New York.</p>\n\n      <p>My Manhattan wardrobe was bursting with fast fashion – pieces I'd wear once or twice before they'd stretch, fade, or fall out of favor. Since moving here, I've been gradually replacing those disposable items with more thoughtful purchases.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2021_04_10-sustainable-fashion-beyond-buzzwords_img02.jpg\" alt=\"My favorite sustainable linen dress from local Sydney designer against the harbor backdrop\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <p>The frustrating part is how confused I get by all the buzzwords. Everything is suddenly \"sustainable,\" \"eco-friendly,\" \"green,\" or \"clean.\" What does that actually mean? Most of these terms have no standardized definitions, which means brands can use them however they want.</p>\n\n      <p>Take \"organic\" cotton – unless it's GOTS certified, that cotton might be grown with fewer pesticides but still processed with harmful chemicals. Or \"vegan leather\" – which is often just plastic. Trading animal welfare for plastic pollution doesn't feel like a solution.</p>\n\n      <p>I've found Australian brands genuinely committed to sustainable practices—transparent supply chains, low-impact materials, and designs meant to last. The price tags are higher, but I've started thinking about cost-per-wear instead of just the initial price.</p>\n\n      <p>Michael teases me: \"Does it count as sustainable if you keep flying across the globe every few years?\" Fair point. My carbon footprint from international moves probably cancels out any good my linen pants are doing. But I still think these smaller choices matter.</p>\n\n      <p>The innovations are eye-opening. A Melbourne designer working with pineapple leaf fibers (Piñatex). A jacket made from recycled ocean plastic in Surry Hills. Several brands using natural dyes from food waste to reduce chemical runoff.</p>\n\n      <p>The most practical change I've made is simply buying less—experimenting with a capsule wardrobe of versatile pieces that mix and match. It's liberating to actually wear everything I own instead of facing that \"nothing to wear\" feeling despite dozens of options.</p>\n\n      <p>I'm also embracing secondhand shopping. Sydney has amazing vintage stores, and I've found incredible pieces with history and character, like a perfectly worn-in 90s denim jacket.</p>\n\n      <p>Australia has been unexpectedly influential in shifting my perspective—there's something about living near the ocean that makes environmental concerns feel more immediate and personal.</p>",
