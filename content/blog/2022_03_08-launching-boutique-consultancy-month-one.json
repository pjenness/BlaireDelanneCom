  "slug": "launching-boutique-consultancy-month-one",
  "excerpt": "The exhilarating reality of building a business from scratch and the unexpected skills I've had to develop beyond my hospitality expertise.",
  "content": "<p>They don't teach you about bookkeeping systems or contract templates in hospitality school. The past month of establishing my consultancy has been an education in aspects of business I never considered while focused on creating beautiful experiences for others.</p>\n      <p>The learning curve has been steep but exhilarating. Each day brings new challengesâ€”from designing my brand identity to establishing service packages to building a network in a new country. What sustains me through the administrative details is the vision of creating truly distinctive, personalized experiences that honor New Zealand's exceptional landscapes and cultures.</p>",
