  "excerpt": "A few days into settling in Martinborough and I'm noticing the quirky details of this wine town.",
  "content": "<p>The town center here is built around a square which gives it a different feel than Auckland. All the street names reference other countries and cities - Venice Street, Dublin Street, etc. Kind of a mini world map in wine country.</p>\n\n      <p>The new fancy housing development is actually called \"Pinot Place\" which made me laugh. This town really loves its wine!</p>\n\n      <p>Had some good meals at local spots:</p>\n\n      <ul class=\"list-disc pl-6 my-4\">\n        <li class=\"mb-2\"><span class=\"font-semibold\">Luna</span> - Good service and nice wine selection. Need to try their special Pinot.</li>\n        <li class=\"mb-2\"><span class=\"font-semibold\">Tohi</span> - Gin bar with tasty Asian kitchen food.</li>\n        <li class=\"mb-2\"><span class=\"font-semibold\">Na Ra</span> - Delicious chicken and waffles!</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>The pace is definitely slower here. People take time to chat, and everyone seems to know each other. Planning to spend the next week or 2 just unwinding, getting a car, exploring around the Wairarapa and maybe into Wellington city.</p>",
