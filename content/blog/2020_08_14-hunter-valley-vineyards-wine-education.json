  "content": "<p>FINALLY made it to the famous Hunter Valley wine region this weekend!! Full disclosure: Despite my old weekend gig at that Oregon wine shop years ago, I felt like a complete wine idiot when it comes to Australian stuff. Turns out knowing about American Pinots is basically useless here. My Uber driver found my confusion about Australian varietals HILARIOUS and spent the entire 40-minute ride calling me a 'typical American.' Whatever, MATE. ðŸ™„</p>\n\n      <p>First vineyard was this bougie place with a gravel driveway longer than several NYC blocks combined. Was lowkey intimidated until our host showed up - Dave, this 60-something dude with a crazy wild gray beard and hands that looked like actual tree bark. Zero pretension. When I confessed I couldn't tell the difference between Shiraz and Cab Sav, he just laughed and went \"Perfect, blank slate!\" instead of the wine-snob judgment I was bracing for.</p>\n\n      <p>The whole 'tasting' ritual was so overwhelming at first. Everyone around me was doing this elaborate swirl-sniff-sip routine, talking about 'notes of blackberry and leather' while I was just concentrating on not spilling red wine all over my white shirt (poor clothing choice, Blaire). Made the CLASSIC rookie mistake of actually DRINKING each sample instead of spitting... by vineyard #3 I was def tipsy. Ended up buying two bottles from the second place that I'm honestly not sure I even liked, but the sommelier was super cute and I got all flustered and just handed over my credit card. So on brand for me.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2020_08_14-hunter-valley-vineyards-wine-education_img02.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret pouring Semillon straight from the tank at her family vineyard\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <p>Hands down, best part wasn't even on our itinerary. Driver took a wrong turn (blame the crazy windy roads, not the wine lol), and we ended up at this tiny family vineyard. The owner, Margaret, was this badass no-nonsense woman who showed us labels designed by her grandkids. She poured us Semillon straight from a TANK (not even a bottle!) and told us they'd had a terrible harvest bc of the bushfires. The smoke had affected the grapes, but she was making wine anyway and calling it their 'Resilience Vintage.' That glass, sitting at this weathered picnic table with her three-legged dog literally snoring on my feet, tasted a million times better than anything at the fancy places with the manicured gardens.</p>\n\n      <p>Michael came with me on this trip â€“ he's kinda become my regular plus-one for Aussie adventures since that first beach day back in March. We have this weirdly comfortable friendship thing going, tho I keep waiting for something to mess it up (bc that's what always happens, right?). Nice having someone equally clueless to learn with tho. Despite being Australian, his entire wine knowledge is literally \"red or white\" and \"under $20.\" His wine reviews were just \"Yeah I'd drink that\" or \"Nah hard pass\" â€“ which MORTIFIED this super serious couple next to us who were writing extensive tasting notes on their phones.</p>\n\n      <p>Something about vineyards makes you weirdly philosophical (or maybe that was just the wine talking lol). Walking between these rows of vines that have been growing for DECADES, still producing fruit year after year no matter what crazy stuff is happening in the world â€“ gives you major perspective on your own problems. Was telling Margaret about my pandemic job stress, and she just pointed at these gnarly old vines and said they'd survived drought, fire, flood, and now smoke damage. \"You'll be right, love,\" she told me in that blunt Aussie way. \"Just need deep roots and the ability to adapt.\" Like... wine wisdom? I'll take it.</p>\n\n      <p>Learned that Semillon is THE Hunter Valley signature white grape (tho I 100% couldn't pick it out of a lineup), and that Australian wine regions are wayyy more diverse than I ever knew. The Hunter makes totally different styles from the Barossa which makes different wines from Margaret River â€“ it's as varied as Napa vs Willamette Valley. Makes me want to explore more wine regions while I'm here (COVID permitting). Michael's already talking about a Barossa Valley trip once state borders reopen, which would be something nice to look forward to in this endless pandemic.</p>\n\n      <p>Super interesting part was hearing how climate change is messing with their harvests. The winemaker at our last stop (after I'd sobered up enough to actually remember stuff) said they're harvesting earlier EVERY year, and alcohol levels in their wines keep rising bc of warmer temps. They're having to change everything from grape varieties to how they design the trellises. Another reminder that your glass of wine is directly connected to the environment it comes from.</p>\n\n      <p>Got home with a POUNDING headache, fried shoulders (memo to self: Australian sun is NOT PLAYING AROUND), and new appreciation for how much crazy work goes into each bottle. Still couldn't tell you much about tannins or terroir, but I've learned good wine is way more about stories and people than price tags. Also learned you should definitely EAT SOMETHING before a wine tour. Major rookie error that I'm still paying for this morning...</p>\n\n      <p>My biggest Hunter Valley accomplishment? I can now pronounce Semillon correctly (it's sem-ih-lon not sem-ih-YOHN), and I've finally found a word that rhymes with DelannÃ©! Small victories!</p>",
