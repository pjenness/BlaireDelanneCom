  "content": "<p>There's something magical about standing in a vineyard, feeling the same soil beneath your feet that nourishes the vines, experiencing the particular quality of sunlight and breeze that will ultimately be expressed in what you taste. Wine appreciation begins long before the glass is poured.</p>\n      <p>This past weekend, I had the privilege of visiting several Hunter Valley estates, spending time with winemakers who spoke about their craft with the same passionate precision I've observed in great chefs. The experience has fundamentally changed how I think about wine service in hospitality settings.</p>",
