  "content": "<p>FINALLY hit up Hunter Valley wine region!! Despite my old Oregon wine shop gig, felt like a total wine idiot with Australian stuff. Knowing American Pinots = useless here. Uber driver found my confusion HILARIOUS, spent the whole ride calling me a 'typical American.' Whatever, MATE. ðŸ™„</p>\n\n      <p>First vineyard was this fancy place with insanely long gravel driveway. Was intimidated until our host Dave showed up - 60-something with wild gray beard and hands like tree bark. Zero pretension. When I admitted I couldn't tell Shiraz from Cab Sav, he just laughed and said \"Perfect, blank slate!\" instead of wine-snob judgment I expected.</p>\n\n      <p>The whole 'tasting' thing was overwhelming. Everyone doing this elaborate swirl-sniff-sip routine, talking about 'notes of blackberry and leather' while I focused on not spilling red wine on my white shirt (dumb choice, Blaire). Made the CLASSIC rookie mistake of actually DRINKING samples instead of spitting... by vineyard #3 I was tipsy. Bought two bottles I'm not sure I even liked because the sommelier was cute and I got flustered. So me.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2020_08_14-hunter-valley-vineyards-wine-education_img02.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret pouring Semillon straight from the tank at her family vineyard\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <p>Best part wasn't even planned. Driver took wrong turn (blame windy roads, not wine lol), and we found this tiny family vineyard. Owner Margaret = badass no-nonsense woman with labels designed by her grandkids. She poured Semillon straight from a TANK and told us about their terrible bushfire-affected harvest. Making wine anyway and calling it 'Resilience Vintage.' That glass, at a weathered picnic table with her three-legged dog snoring on my feet, beat anything from the fancy places.</p>\n\n      <p>Michael came with - he's my regular plus-one for Aussie adventures since that first beach day in March. Got this comfortable friendship, tho I keep waiting for something to mess it up (as usual, right?). Nice having a fellow clueless person. Despite being Australian, his wine knowledge is just \"red or white\" and \"under $20.\" His reviews: \"Yeah I'd drink that\" or \"Nah hard pass\" - which HORRIFIED the serious couple next to us writing tasting notes on their phones.</p>\n\n      <p>Vineyards make you philosophical (or was it the wine? lol). Walking between vines growing for DECADES, still producing through everything - gives perspective on your problems. Told Margaret about my pandemic stress, and she pointed at these gnarly old vines that survived drought, fire, flood, and smoke. \"You'll be right, love. Just need deep roots and ability to adapt.\" Wine wisdom? I'll take it.</p>\n\n      <p>Learned Semillon is THE Hunter Valley white grape (tho couldn't ID it in a lineup), and Australian wine regions are super diverse. Hunter makes different styles from Barossa which differs from Margaret River - varied as Napa vs Willamette. Want to explore more regions (COVID permitting). Michael's talking Barossa trip once borders reopen - something to look forward to in this pandemic.</p>\n\n      <p>Climate change is messing with their harvests. Winemaker at our last stop said they're harvesting earlier EVERY year, with higher alcohol levels from warmer temps. Changing everything from grape varieties to trellis designs. Reminder that wine connects directly to its environment.</p>\n\n      <p>Got home with POUNDING headache, fried shoulders (memo: Australian sun is BRUTAL), and new respect for winemaking. Still clueless about tannins or terroir, but learned wine is about stories and people, not price. Also learned: EAT BEFORE wine tours. Major mistake still hurting this morning...</p>\n\n      <p>Biggest accomplishment? I can pronounce Semillon correctly (sem-ih-lon not sem-ih-YOHN), and found a word that rhymes with DelannÃ©! Small wins!</p>",
