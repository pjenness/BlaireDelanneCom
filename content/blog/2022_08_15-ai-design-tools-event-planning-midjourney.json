  "content": "<p>Bougie wedding client asked if I've tried \"Midjourney\" yet. I was like what?? Cue 1am internet rabbit hole, and now I'm weeks deep in this AI pic generator. Still processing what this means for people who actually make stuff for a living.</p>\n\n      <p>If you haven't heard of it (I hadn't!), Midjourney = type what you want, boom - AI makes images. Like ACTUAL images that sometimes look freakishly good. Mind-blowing.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2022_08_15-ai-design-tools-event-planning-midjourney_img02.jpg\" alt=\"AI-generated image of an elegant tablescape with native New Zealand elements\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <p>First tries = garbage. Typed \"elegant wedding table with NZ elements\" and got weird mashups like tourism ads + wedding mags had a baby. But after tweaking prompts (super specific ones), some looked... decent? Actually useful?</p>\n\n      <p>Now using these AI pics in client meetings for mood boards. Instead of 3-hour Pinterest hunts for that *perfect* inspo, I generate something close to what's in my head. Game changer for explaining vibes to clients who don't \"get it\".</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">The Good & The WTF</h3>\n\n      <p>Big win = speed. Mood boards that took days now happen during lunch. Real magic? Showing clients different versions of \"rustic elegance\" or whatever buzzwords they're obsessed with.</p>\n\n      <p>Had this picky client wanting \"understated luxury with natural elements\" for winter wedding. We pictured totally different things. Showed AI versions, they pointed and went \"THAT ONE\" and FINALLY got somewhere. Saved weeks of back-and-forth.</p>\n\n      <p>But these tools get weird. Hands with 6 fingers. Melty champagne glasses. Chandeliers defying physics. Good for vibes, useless for actual planning.</p>\n\n      <p>Plus AI knows NOTHING about real event problems. Shows gorgeous ceiling installation with 10,000 fresh flowers, but zero clue about weight limits, engineering, or flowers turning brown after 5 hours in summer heat.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">The Awkward Ethics Bit</h3>\n\n      <p>Not gonna lie, this makes me uncomfortable. I work with amazing photographers, florists and designers. These AI models trained on their work without asking. Feels... not great.</p>\n\n      <p>Super clear with clients these are just inspo starting points. Still hire (and pay!!) real creatives for actual work. Some vendor friends freaking out about this tech, others already using it to brainstorm.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">Finding My Way</h3>\n\n      <p>For now, treating this as another tool - helpful for ideas and client convos, not replacing the talented humans who make events happen.</p>\n\n      <p>Coolest part? Trying combos I'd never think of. Asked for Art Deco mixed with MƒÅori design for corporate event. Most results = culturally cringey garbage, but couple sparked ideas. Then did proper research and talked to actual cultural advisors since AI is clueless about cultural nuance.</p>\n\n      <p>This tech evolving scary fast. July's output looks like kindergarten art compared to August's. And next version apparently way better?!</p>\n\n      <p>End of day, our job isn't just pretty pictures. It's knowing how guests move through spaces, how drunk people behave after midnight, how sunset timing affects everything, and how to EXECUTE, not just imagine. No AI replacing actual expertise (yet???).</p>\n\n      <p>Any other event peeps trying this? Loving it, hating it, or conflicted like me?</p>",
