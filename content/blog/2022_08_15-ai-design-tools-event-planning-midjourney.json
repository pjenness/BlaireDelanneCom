  "content": "<p>So this bougie wedding client hit me up last month asking if I've tried \"Midjourney\" yet. I was like what?? But after going down an internet rabbit hole at 1am (as you do), I've spent weeks messing with this AI pic generator. Still trying to wrap my head around what this means for people like me who actually make stuff for a living.</p>\n\n      <p>If you haven't heard of it (I hadn't!), Midjourney is this AI thing where you type what you want to see, and boom - it spits out images. Like actual images that sometimes look freakishly good. It's weird and kinda mind-blowing.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2022_08_15-ai-design-tools-event-planning-midjourney_img02.jpg\" alt=\"AI-generated image of an elegant tablescape with native New Zealand elements\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <p>My first tries were proper trash - typed \"elegant wedding table with NZ elements\" and got these bizarre mashups that looked like a tourism ad had a baby with a wedding mag. But after tweaking my prompts (gotta be super specific apparently), some actually looked... decent? Useful even?</p>\n\n      <p>Started using these AI pics in client meetings for mood boards. Instead of trawling Pinterest for 3 hours hunting for that *perfect* inspo image, I can generate something close to what's in my head. Game changer for explaining vibes to clients who don't \"get it\".</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">The Good & The WTF</h3>\n\n      <p>Obvs the big win is speed - mood boards that took forever now happen in like, an actual lunch break. But the real magic? Showing clients different versions of \"rustic elegance\" or whatever buzzwords they're fixated on.</p>\n\n      <p>Had this fussy client who kept saying they wanted \"understated luxury with natural elements\" for their winter wedding. We were totally picturing different things. After showing them a bunch of AI versions, they pointed and went \"THAT ONE\" and we finally got somewhere. Saved weeks of back-and-forth BS.</p>\n\n      <p>But these tools are janky af sometimes. Hands with 6 fingers. Melty-looking champagne glasses. Chandeliers that defy physics. Good for the vibe, useless for actual planning.</p>\n\n      <p>Plus these AI things know nothing about real-world event problems. Sure it can show a gorgeous ceiling installation of 10,000 fresh flowers, but has zero clue about weight limits, structural engineering, or the fact that those blooms will be sad brown mush after 5 hours in summer heat.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">The Awkward Ethics Bit</h3>\n\n      <p>Not gonna lie, this stuff makes me uncomfortable sometimes. I work with amazing photographers and florists and designers. These AI models got trained on their work without asking. Feels... not great.</p>\n\n      <p>I'm super clear with clients that these are just inspo starting points. Still hire (and pay!!) real creatives for the actual work. Some of my vendor friends are freaking out about this tech, others are already using it themselves to brainstorm. Interesting times.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">Finding My Way</h3>\n\n      <p>For now I'm treating this as another tool in the box - helpful for ideas and client convos, but not replacing the actual talented humans who make events happen.</p>\n\n      <p>The coolest part? Trying combos I'd never think of. Asked it to show Art Deco mixed with MƒÅori design elements for this corporate thing. Most results were culturally cringey garbage, but a couple sparked ideas I wouldn't have considered. Obviously then did proper research and talked to actual cultural advisors cuz AI is clueless about cultural nuance.</p>\n\n      <p>This tech is evolving scary fast. The stuff it made in July looks like kindergarten art compared to what it's doing now in August. And I've heard the next version is already way better?!</p>\n\n      <p>Look, at the end of the day, our job isn't just making pretty pictures. It's knowing how guests move through spaces, how drunk people behave after midnight, how a sunset timing change affects everything, and how to actually EXECUTE, not just imagine. No AI can replace actually knowing your shit (yet???).</p>\n\n      <p>Any other event peeps tried this stuff? Curious if you're loving it, hating it, or somewhere in the middle like me.</p>",
