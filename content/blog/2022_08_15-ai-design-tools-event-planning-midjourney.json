  "content": "<p>Last month, a tech-savvy wedding client asked if I'd heard of something called \"Midjourney.\" I hadn't, but after a quick dive down the rabbit hole, I've spent the past few weeks experimenting with this fascinating new AI image generation tool—and I'm still processing what it might mean for creative industries like mine.</p>\n\n      <p>For those unfamiliar (as I was until recently), Midjourney is one of several new AI systems that can generate surprisingly sophisticated images based on text descriptions. You simply type a prompt describing what you want to see, and within seconds, the AI creates original visuals matching your description.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2022_08_15-ai-design-tools-event-planning-midjourney_img02.jpg\" alt=\"AI-generated image of an elegant tablescape with native New Zealand elements\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <p>My first attempts were clumsy—\"elegant wedding table with New Zealand elements\" produced some bizarre results that looked like a tourism brochure collided with a wedding magazine. But as I refined my prompts, adding specific details about textures, lighting, and mood, the results became increasingly useful for conceptual inspiration.</p>\n\n      <p>I've now incorporated AI-generated images into my initial client presentation process, specifically for mood boards and concept development. Rather than spending hours searching stock photography sites for that perfect image that matches what I'm envisioning, I can now generate custom visuals that more precisely communicate the feeling I want to create.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">The Benefits and Limitations</h3>\n\n      <p>The most obvious benefit is speed—creating a comprehensive mood board that once took days can now be assembled in hours. But beyond efficiency, I'm finding that AI images can help bridge communication gaps with clients who struggle to visualize abstract concepts.</p>\n\n      <p>For instance, when discussing a winter wedding concept centered around \"understated luxury with natural elements,\" the client and I were interpreting these terms quite differently. After generating several variations of this theme through Midjourney, we quickly identified which visual direction resonated and which didn't, saving weeks of potential misalignment.</p>\n\n      <p>That said, these tools have clear limitations. The images often have strange inconsistencies—extra fingers on hands, oddly melting objects, or physically impossible architectural elements. They're wonderful for conceptual direction but useless for detailed planning or execution.</p>\n\n      <p>More importantly, these AI systems don't understand the practical realities of event execution. They might generate a breathtaking floral installation cascading from a ceiling, but have no concept of weight, structural support requirements, or how such arrangements would fare over hours in variable temperatures.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">Ethical Considerations</h3>\n\n      <p>There are also significant ethical questions about these technologies. As someone who works closely with photographers, florists, and other creative professionals, I'm acutely aware that these AI models have been trained on millions of images created by human artists—often without their knowledge or consent.</p>\n\n      <p>I'm being careful about how I use and present these tools. I always clarify to clients that AI images are conceptual starting points, not end products, and I continue to hire and credit professional photographers and illustrators for final deliverables.</p>\n\n      <p>I've had fascinating conversations with creative partners about these technologies. Some view AI as an existential threat to their livelihoods, while others are already incorporating these tools into their workflows, using them to explore ideas before executing with their own distinct artistic vision.</p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"font-playfair text-2xl font-semibold my-4\">Finding the Right Balance</h3>\n\n      <p>For now, I'm viewing AI image generation as another tool in my creative process—valuable for ideation and communication, but not a replacement for human expertise, craftsmanship, or the irreplaceable magic of collaborating with talented artists and makers.</p>\n\n      <p>What I find most exciting is how these tools can expand my creative horizons. When brainstorming a recent event concept, I prompted Midjourney to show me combinations I wouldn't naturally consider—like Art Deco aesthetics merged with traditional Māori design elements. While many results were culturally jumbled and inappropriate, a few sparked interesting directions that I then refined through proper research and consultation with cultural advisors.</p>\n\n      <p>I suspect we're just seeing the beginning of how AI will influence creative fields. Already, the quality and capabilities of these systems have advanced dramatically in just the few months I've been experimenting with them. The AI-generated images from July look primitive compared to what the same systems can create now in August.</p>\n\n      <p>As event designers, our value has never been just in creating pretty pictures—it's in our deep understanding of how spaces flow, how people interact, how sensory elements combine to create emotional experiences, and perhaps most importantly, how to transform conceptual ideas into practical, executable plans. No AI system (yet) can replace that holistic expertise.</p>\n\n      <p>I'm curious to hear from others in the industry—have you experimented with these new AI tools? How do you see them fitting into (or disrupting) your creative process?</p>",
