  "content": "<p>The definition of luxury hospitality continues to evolve, with wellness now taking center stage in how we design and execute special events. This shift moves beyond superficial indulgence to create experiences that genuinely nurture guests' wellbeing—addressing physical, mental, and spiritual dimensions.</p>\n      <p>In my recent projects across New Zealand, I've incorporated wellness elements that reflect our unique landscape and culture: guided forest bathing experiences before wedding ceremonies, sound healing with traditional Māori instruments, and menus designed around locally-foraged ingredients with specific wellness properties.</p>",
