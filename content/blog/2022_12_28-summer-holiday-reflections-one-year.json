  "content": "<p>Another hemisphere shift, another summer Christmas—though this one feels different from those Australian celebrations. As I mark a full year in New Zealand and the holiday season provides space for reflection, I'm struck by how profoundly this place has influenced both my personal outlook and professional approach.</p>\n\n      <p>The decision to launch my own consultancy rather than joining an established organization was driven partly by a desire for creative autonomy, but also by recognition that New Zealand's hospitality and event landscape offered opportunities to develop approaches that wouldn't fit neatly into existing models.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2022_12_28-summer-holiday-reflections-one-year_img02.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset view from a beach in Coromandel Peninsula during summer holiday break\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <p>I'm writing this from a quiet beach house on the Coromandel Peninsula, where I've escaped for a week of decompression after what has been both the most challenging and rewarding year of my career. The rhythmic sound of waves and lack of urban distractions have created the perfect environment to take stock of what I've learned and where I'm headed.</p>\n\n      <p>Looking back at my journal entries from January, I'm amused by my naive assumptions about how quickly I'd establish myself here. I'd come from Sydney with a solid reputation and portfolio, and part of me expected that would translate immediately. What I didn't fully appreciate was how much Auckland, despite its cosmopolitan veneer, operates on relationships and community connections that take genuine time to build.</p>\n\n      <p>My first three months were humbling. Meetings that I thought would lead to immediate collaborations often ended with polite interest but no commitments. I found myself questioning my decision to move, wondering if I'd misread the potential here. There were nights spent scrolling Sydney job listings and considering a retreat to the familiar.</p>\n\n      <p>The turning point came unexpectedly through a chance connection at a local farmers' market, where a conversation with a woman selling honey led to an introduction to her daughter—a wedding planner who needed help with a complicated destination celebration. That single project opened doors to a network of creative professionals who have since become not just colleagues but friends.</p>\n\n      <p>What I've come to value most about the New Zealand approach to business is the emphasis on authenticity over polish. In Sydney, I often felt pressure to project a certain image of sleek perfection. Here, there's more appreciation for transparency about both strengths and limitations. Clients respond to genuine expertise delivered with humanity rather than a flawless but impersonal facade.</p>\n\n      <p>This shift has allowed me to develop more authentic relationships with clients and collaborators. I'm no longer crafting elaborate presentations with stock imagery and marketing language. Instead, I share real examples, honest assessments, and personal stories that illustrate my approach. The result has been deeper connections and projects that truly align with my values.</p>\n\n      <p>On the personal front, I've finally begun to feel settled in my little apartment in Ponsonby. After years of viewing each home as temporary, I've found myself investing in pieces that can't be easily packed into suitcases—a vintage sideboard from a local antique shop, art from New Zealand painters, even plants that require long-term care. These choices feel significant, signals to myself that I'm putting down roots.</p>\n\n      <p>My mother's observation about my \"gypsy soul\" has echoed in my mind lately. She's always attributed my restlessness to some inherent quality, but I'm beginning to wonder if it wasn't just a response to circumstances—particularly relationships that didn't work out. Each major move in my adult life has followed the end of a significant relationship, and perhaps I've used geographical shifts as a way to process those endings.</p>\n\n      <p>Being in New Zealand has offered a different perspective. The relative isolation of these islands creates a certain mindfulness about arrivals and departures. Moving here involves intention rather than impulse. While I initially worried this might feel constraining after the easy mobility between major global cities, I've found it grounding instead.</p>\n\n      <p>As for the year ahead, I have a clearer vision now than I did twelve months ago. Rather than trying to recreate my Sydney career here, I'm leaning into what makes the New Zealand market distinctive. I'm focusing my consultancy on projects that showcase local producers, artisans, and venues in ways that feel authentic rather than contrived. And I'm making time for exploration beyond Auckland, recognizing that understanding this country's diverse regions is essential to the work I want to do.</p>\n\n      <p>For now, though, I'm embracing this quiet week by the ocean—watching tuis in the pohutukawa trees, swimming in the clear water, and feeling grateful for this unexpected chapter in my story. If you had told me two years ago that I'd be building a new life in New Zealand, I might have laughed. But sometimes the paths we don't anticipate lead us exactly where we need to be.</p>",
