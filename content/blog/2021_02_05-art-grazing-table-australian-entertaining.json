  "content": "<p>There's this distinctly Aussie approach to hospitality - abundance without formality, fancy without stuffiness. And nothing shows this better than these epic grazing tables I've been doing at Harbour House.</p>\n\n      <p>I'm talking massive spreads with cheese, meats, fruits, dips, breads arranged like edible art installations. They're not just food - they're an experience that keeps guests coming back throughout the event.</p>\n\n      <p>Never even heard of a proper grazing table before Australia! In NYC, we did cheese boards or passed apps, but nothing this scale. First saw one at a colleague's bday and was like WOAH - this display was literally art you could eat.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"/images/blog/2021_02_05-art-grazing-table-australian-entertaining_img02.jpg\" alt=\"Close-up of my first grazing table creation with Australian cheeses, native fruits, and edible flowers\" class=\"my-6 w-full rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <p>Got completely obsessed with learning how to do them. There's legit technique to it - layering, height variations, color balancing. Like painting but with food. Start with big stuff for structure, add smaller bits, finish with delicate touches like edible flowers.</p>\n\n      <p>Did my first pro grazing table for a corporate thing last month. 3 hours building this beast with local cheeses (this Tasmanian truffle brie = INSANE), honeycomb, quince paste, crackers. Added prosciutto and salami in these fancy ribbon patterns, fruits, nuts, olives, dips. Finished with herbs and flowers.</p>\n\n      <p>Guests went nuts - half of them taking pics before anyone dared grab food! Boss was impressed enough to ask me to create a signature Harbour House grazing style.</p>\n\n      <p>Best part? How it breaks down stuffiness. People gather around, reach across each other, chat and recommend things. Zero formality. Even at fancy corporate events, the grazing table becomes this conversation starter that chills everyone out.</p>\n\n      <p>Such a contrast to the precisely portioned, formal service I learned in NY. Something so generous about saying \"here's tons of beautiful food - help yourself, come back, explore at your own pace.\" Perfect example of what I love about Aussie culture: high quality but super casual.</p>\n\n      <p>Michael says I'm becoming \"properly Australian\" with my grazing table obsession. Maybe! But I think I'm just falling for a hospitality style that makes people feel special AND comfortable at the same time. Impressive but approachable - exactly what good hospitality should be.</p>",
