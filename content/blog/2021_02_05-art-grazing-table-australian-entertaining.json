  "excerpt": "How Australia's relaxed approach to luxury entertaining has influenced my event design philosophy and transformed my approach to hospitality.",
  "content": "<p>There's a distinctly Australian approach to hospitality that emphasizes abundance without formality, sophistication without stuffiness. Perhaps nothing embodies this philosophy better than the elaborate grazing tables that have become central to events I've planned with Celestial Celebrations.</p>\n      <p>These artful arrangements—where cheese, charcuterie, fruits, dips, breads, and more are assembled into an edible landscape—invite guests to interact, share, and return throughout an event. They transform food service from a scheduled activity into an ongoing experience.</p>",
