  "excerpt": "The delightful contradiction of Christmas in summer and how seasonal celebrations take on new meaning across hemispheres.",
  "content": "<p>There's something wonderfully disorienting about preparing for Christmas while temperatures soar into the 90s. All the familiar symbols remain—the trees, the lights, the festive music—yet they exist in a completely different context. Santa hats paired with swimsuits. Elaborate seafood feasts rather than roast dinners. Carol concerts on the beach.</p>\n      <p>As someone deeply attached to seasonal traditions, I've found this hemisphere shift prompts reflection on what these celebrations really mean beyond their weather-specific trappings. The essence—gathering, gratitude, marking time's passage—remains constant even when the expression evolves.</p>",
